On April 16, he announced he was sending 100 to New Jersey.\" I'm morbidly fascinated by what you're reading that has led you to this belief. Re: ICU beds: I was talking about the world generally rather than New York specifically. For example in New Jersey on April 8th only 3 hospitals were load balancing to others: https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexberenson\/status\/1247920918640410624?... In New York city (vs state) the field hospitals that were built have hardly been being used. https:\/\/eu.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/health\/2020\/04\/16\/coronav... \"the field hospital constructed inside the massive Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Hudson Yards, had 340 patients as of Tuesday afternoon ... The facility has a maximum capacity of 2,500 hospital beds. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Javits Center hospital had treated about 700 patients\" Even on April 1st, the New York Post visited an ICU and found it was only handling double the normal case load, well within capacity (13 patients normally, 26 then): https:\/\/nypost.com\/2020\/04\/01\/a-look-inside-an-nyc-hospital-... Certainly there are cases where single hospitals ran out of space and started load balancing onto nearby hospitals. But, that happens during normal times too. Where are you reading this? [empty hospitals] The essay isn't only about New York, it's trying to generalise not only to America but the whole western world. And across the world hospitals are laying off staff due to underload: https:\/\/news.google.com\/search?q=hospital%20furlough&hl=en-U... Who would CPAP machines be for? Why bring them up? CPAP - the pressure type, not the sleep machines - is now a common therapy for treating COVID-19. For example the British Prime Minister wasn't put on a ventilator but rather given only CPAP (basically, a mask connected to the hospital oxygen supply). This is because there's a growing belief in the medical world that ventilators can cause more harm than good for COVID patients. https:\/\/www.medscape.com\/viewarticle\/928156 None of which are actually effective in the face of historic unemployment. That's not a rebuttal. Systems to distribute money exist. The idea they've never been built, as the essay argues, isn't right. If you want to argue they aren't designed for sustaining a world under house arrest, by all means do so, but no country on earth has created schemes specifically for that. Making masks which reduce individual aerosol dispersal is easy. N95 masks are harder Andreessen was talking about medical-grade masks designed to protect doctors from patients, not ad-hoc home made things. And for those masks the point stands: it's hard to make them but he says it's easy. As for medical literature, go read the links to papers and studies here: https:\/\/swprs.org\/a-swiss-doctor-on-covid-19\/ There are many links to papers, comments and articles by doctors and other specialists who are arguing that the virus is clearly not as deadly as feared. For example, the serology survey that's in the first link under the April 18th update was discussed here on HN just recently. That's good news, by the way! Don't you hope they're right? My experience is that some people posting on HN don't actually want to study what people bringing good news are saying.","salty_score":0.4527710743},{"rank":51,"user_name":"jldugger","text":"Honestly, I find Marketplace's obsession with politics annoying.

Your link fails to address your assertion at all.

You either need to know, or be able to request, a given key to validate it, or transmissions based on it. TLS (as SSL before it) relies on certificate authorities (CAs), whose keys 1) are distributed to all major browsers and\/or operating systems, and 2) which then vouch for website keys.  Other mechanisms (e.g., key pinning) are also used.  This model has many critics. PGP (or Gnupg, and alternate implementation) rely, also to various degrees of general criticism, on a web of trust model, in which keys are signed by various other keys, possibly but not necessarily the user's own.  Trust is ideally personally verified.  It's been observed that this poses scaling issues. Other PKI models have their own approaches to key trust. S\/MIME uses CAs similarly to TLS\/SSL, for key authentication, but keys themselves must still be retained, and secured, to assure future data access and integrity.  SSH effectively relies on TOFU (trust on first use) or OOB (out of band) key distribution -- both of which effectively punt the process. TLS, SSL, and SSH are all session-based (data-in-flight) protocols.  PGP and S\/MIME are storage-oriented, data-at-rest protocols.

The up to two-day delay in the administration of HCQ after admittance to the study is disheartening. I am surprised that, despite the experimentors selecting an elderly, pneumonic, oxygen-dependent cohort in advanced stages of the disease, these patients did as well as they did. Its a credit to the human body. But timing is everything... Once a Covid-19 patient has developed pneumonia, it is too late for hydroxychloroquine to affect the Covid-19 virus' replication process significantly. The patient's body is saturated with the virus. In a patient who has developed pneumonia the disease has progressed to a  second phase wherein the virus and other opportunistic pathogens (e.g., bacteria) attack the lungs and other tissue. Antibiotics may help at this point. But it is quite clear that the patients in this study arrived too late to gain any benefit from hydroxychloroquine  which, when coupled with zinc sulfate, slows or halts viral replication _early_ in the disease, delays or halts the virus' progress and allows the body time to develop an immunological response to the virus. The study's conclusion states explicitly that \" These results ... do not support the use of HCQ in patients hospitalised for a documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\" So, the trick is to treat _early_ with HCQ+zinc sulfate+azithromycin.","salty_score":0.4656824665},{"rank":90,"user_name":"skavi","text":"Each A13 Lightning core has around 2.5x the transistors of a Skylake core.
